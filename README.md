# Multi-sensor2WQTS
This R project proposes to create data management pipeline from multiple make and models of data logging data sondes for collecting water quality data and save the processed data to a SQL Server database called WQTS (water quality time series).
The initial project includes code and sample data from a HOBO water temperature and dissolved oxygen sensor/logger. The first sensor/logger is the HoboÂ® DO/ Temperature data loggers (Model U26-001)
The plan is to add additional sensors. 
The WQTS database was developed and provide by the NW Indian Fisheries Commission
University of Washington Department of Statistics students and facility contributed to this project. EPA TXG supported this work.
